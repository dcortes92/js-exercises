## Objective

Now we'll look at keyboard events. To pass this assessment you need to build an event handler that moves the circle around the provided canvas when the WASD keys are pressed on the keyboard. The circle is drawn with the function drawCircle(), which takes the following parameters as inputs:

* x — the x coordinate of the circle.
* y — the y coordinate of the circle.
* size — the radius of the circle.
